### **Scenario: Company Growth Project - Phase 1**
#### **Phase 1: Small Startup Network**

**Objective:**  
You are the network engineer for a small startup called "TechLaunch" that has just set up an office. TechLaunch has 5 employees working on desktop PCs, one printer, and one central server. They have a single network switch, and the network must provide connectivity to all devices in a single IP range.

**Requirements:**
1. **Network Devices:**
   - **One Cisco 2960 Switch:** This will connect all internal devices.
   - **One Cisco Router (e.g., 1941 or 2911):** To manage the network and eventually connect it to an external network (Internet).
2. **End Devices:**
   - 5 PCs for employees.
   - 1 Printer for shared use.
   - 1 Server for file storage, web hosting, or internal applications.
3. **IP Addressing:**
   - Use a single subnet, for example, **10.0.0.0/8**.
4. **DHCP Setup:**  
   - Configure the router to assign IP addresses dynamically to all PCs.
5. **Connectivity:**
   - Ensure all devices can communicate with each other within the network.

### **What's Next?**

In **Phase 2**, we’ll expand this network to simulate a growing company. We'll add a second subnet, implement VLANs to segregate departments, and introduce a firewall for added security.

Let me know when you’re ready to move to the next phase, or if you have any questions while setting up Phase 1!
