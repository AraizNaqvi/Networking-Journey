You are to configure the network as follows:

1. 3650 = Layer 3 switch with IP Address and interVLAN routing:
	- VLAN 1 = 10.1.1.254/24
	- VLAN 10 = 10.1.10.254/24
	- VLAN 20 = 10.1..30.254/24
	- VLAN 30 = 10.1.100.254/24
	- VLAN 100 = 10.1.100.254/24

2. Access layer switches will only have management IP addresses in VLAN 1:
	- Switch 1 = 10.1.1.1/24
	- Switch 2 = 10.1.1.2/24
	- Switch 3 = 10.1.1.3/24

3. Configure access ports as follows:
	- PC1 in VLAN 10 = 10.1.10.10/24
	- PC2 in VLAN 20 = 10.1.20.20/24
	- PC3 in VLAN 30 = 10.1.30.30/24
	- Server1 in VLAN 100 = 10.1.100.100/24

4. Configure ports between switches as trunks
5. Make sure that PC's can ping each other and the server
6. Make sure that switches can ping the PC's and server.
